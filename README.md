  ## Description
  
  This application will prompt the user a series of questions about various employees (Manager, Engineer, Intern). Prompted questions include name, employee ID number, and email. If entering an engineer, a GitHub username prompt is presented, and for intern a School question is asked instead. Multiple entries can be made for engineer and intern based on how many employees there are. This application will completely write and style a HTML file to display on the web.
